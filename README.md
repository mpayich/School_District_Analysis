# School_District_Analysis
### Overview of the school district analysis:
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. The first step is to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once the math and reading scores are replaced, the data can be analyzed.
